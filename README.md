# Robot GG Simulation
This is just a simple program for finding shortest path using A-Star. The problem is from my document, link to be announced. What you can do is:
- Make sure you have Java.
- Make the initial state for the problem whatever you want in `src/RobotGGSimulation.java`, in edit area.
- Run using `run.bat`. (for Windows)
