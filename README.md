# Robot GG Simulation
This is just a simple program for finding shortest path using A-Star. The problem is from my document (https://informatika.stei.itb.ac.id/~rinaldi.munir/Stmik/2020-2021/Makalah2021/Makalah-Stima-2021-K3%20(49).pdf). What you can do is:
- Make sure you have Java.
- Make the initial state for the problem whatever you want in `src/RobotGGSimulation.java`, in edit area.
- Run using `run.bat`. (for Windows)
